        <h3> National Transgender HIV Testing Day</h3>
        <p> Apr 18, 2017</p>
        <p>
I worked on this article for National Transgender HIV Testing Day, which was on April 18. Our schools health service center offers the anti-HIV medication PrEP and PEP. The medications have been offered for only a year and I thought it was important we make students aware of that health services offer this medication.</p>

      <h3> The Stone Moves to The New School</h3>
      <p> May 11, 2017</p>
      <p>The Stone is a small music space in Alphabet City in NYC. This project was meant to capture reactions about the venue moving to The New School and provide information on the move. This was for my final project in my News Narrative and Design II class. We were given the task of covering a local news story. </p>

          <p>This is my first infographic I created in October 2016. This graphic was to be a resource for students voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. It was printed as a poster and hung around all campus buildings. </p>

          <h3> Pizza</h3>
          <p> May 6, 2016</p>
          <p>This project was for my "Reporting Without Words," class. This class was a printmaking and journlaism class. We had to create an 8-part story using only images and no words. I hand carved eight 4X6 linoleum blocks to create my story which was about a local pizza shop that increased their dollar slices to $2 and then back to $1 after they started to lose buisness.</p>
